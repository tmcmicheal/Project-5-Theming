Title: Tips & Tricks

----

Text: Here's a quick list of tips along with some short explanations to get you on your way to being a better barista...

1. PURIFIED WATER: You will be amazed at the difference in your coffee if you use purified, clean water. Stop using that nasty faucet stuff and get a filter of some kind, heating the water to 200 degrees. The best coffee requires the best water, no exceptions.

2. STORAGE: Don't you dare refrigerate your coffee. If you have a large amount that needs to be stored, freeze it (just make sure it's completely sealed). Otherwise, keep it in an airtight container, preferably in the shade.

3. GRINDING: Use a Burr grinder because the blade grinders tend to be inconsistent and heat the beans while grinding. Don't grind your beans unless you're ready to brew coffee.

4. PROPORTIONS: Make sure you get the right amount of coffee for the amount of water you're using. Four tablespoon of ground coffee to 12oz of water works for automatic drip machines.

5. BEANS: Generally speaking, the less oil on the coffee bean surface, the better. Starbucks is known for their dark, nearly burnt flavored coffee, so their beans seem to be very oily. Look for more dry beans for a more balanced coffee.
