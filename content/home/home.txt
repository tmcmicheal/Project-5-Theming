Title: The Barista's Handbook

----

Text: Whether or not you enjoy this classic beverage, you must admit that there’s a certain art to coffee. It’s a delicate task to brew the perfect cup and there’s endless methods, tricks, categories and opinions when it comes to coffee brewing, not to mention the massive amount of types and flavors available. We exist to make the task a little less daunting and a little more approachable. We want you to make good coffee and have fun doing it.  You don’t have to work at a giant corporation like Starbucks (in fact, we don’t encourage it) to be a good barista.
